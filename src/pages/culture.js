          Over the last 7 years, weâ€™ve been learning from our wins and losses. 
          Every person and experience have shaped our culture, and we expect that to continue forever.

          <p>
          We donâ€™t believe hierarchies mean much in our industry. 
          At Yellowme we are a community of committed designers and engineers with a shared value system. 
          We reject bureaucracy and believe in simple and thoughtful processes.

          <h2>Be a leader.</h2>
          <p>
          Leadership is not management. Leadership starts with oneâ€™s self and never ends. 
          A true leader inspires their peers, apprentices, other leaders and the community at large.

          <p>
          We donâ€™t simply place you on a project. 
          Yellowme makes sure that you are fully committed to the purpose of the client youâ€™re working with and deeply care about the challenge ahead.

          We are not an agency or a dev shop. We build real world teams. 
          This means putting the work alongside our clients to establish the tools, process, mindset and camaraderie that make a group successful in the long run.
